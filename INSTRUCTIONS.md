# PriceWatcher Repository Instructions

## Overview

**PriceWatcher** is a Python application designed to retrieve the prices of grocery products from the web using web scraping techniques. The results are displayed in a table format, making it easy for users to compare different products and brands. Users can input several details, such as the item’s common name (optionally with a specific brand), and receive organized price data in response.

## Main Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automatically fetches current prices of grocery items from online sources.
- **Custom Queries**: Users can specify the product name and brand for targeted results.
- **Tabular Display**: Results are shown in a clear table, simplifying comparisons.
- **Multi-Item Search**: Supports searches for multiple products at once.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic familiarity with command-line usage

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coderao1/PriceWatcher.git
   cd PriceWatcher
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - (If a `requirements.txt` file exists, run:)
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Otherwise, install common packages manually (e.g., `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pandas`):
     ```bash
     pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
     ```

3. **Configuration**
   - Check for any configuration files (e.g., `.env`) and set up API keys or environment variables if required.

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Program**
   - If there is a main script (e.g., `main.py`), run:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input Product Details**
   - Enter the common name of the item (e.g., "Milk", "Bread").
   - Optionally, specify a particular brand (e.g., "Amul Milk").
   - You can enter several items for simultaneous price retrieval.

3. **View Results**
   - The application will scrape prices and display them in a table format.
   - Compare prices across brands and stores directly in the output.

### Example Workflow

```text
Input: 
  1. Item: Milk
  2. Item: Bread (Brand: Britannia)
  3. Item: Rice

Output:
  | Item     | Brand      | Store      | Price  |
  |----------|------------|------------|--------|
  | Milk     | Amul       | Store A    | ₹60    |
  | Bread    | Britannia  | Store B    | ₹30    |
  | Rice     | Daawat     | Store C    | ₹120   |
